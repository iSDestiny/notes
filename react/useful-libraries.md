# Useful libraries for React

## [React Query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/)

Very useful library for data fetching. Will use this instead of axios from now on. On top of fetching the data
it also manages your server state for you. So instead of keeping track of your server state with a useState and
propogating it with a useEffect or something, react query will handle all of that for you!

## [Faker.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/Faker)

When you are working on your frontend but do not have backend or any source of data set up yet, you usually have to hard code
your data for prototyping. Instead of having to hard code all of that, Faker.js does all of that for you. Faker.js can generate
the fake data for you.
