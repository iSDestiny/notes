# notes

Collection of my notes, and also my daily journal stored on github to share it across my devices
I am using a vscode extension called Notes in order to take my notes. All the files with a .notes
have special syntax that is deteced by the plugin in order to do syntax highlighting so it looks
good on vscode but is just plaintext on github or anywhere without the extension.

**NOTE: The first 9 days of my journal were written using a different platform that's why the date of
creation does not match when it was actually written.**
