Finished one module today on my node.js course. Today I learned why validation of user input is
important. You don't want users to send incorrect input to the server and it is important to get
input in the way you expect it, such as emails being valid emails (i.e. test@test.com). I also learned
that validation on the server side (node.js) is what really matters and client side validation is nice
but optional since the user can just disable JavaScript to bypass this. I implemented authorization for
the login, signup, add product, and edit product pages.
