Today, instead of working ony MarkdownV I had to work on Maverick because the users found
some bugs. After extensive testing I found that the found they found let to even more bugs so
I had to change a lot of the functionality of the admin form of the application. I made it so
the add button is now available at all times except if there is an error. I also made it so if
you press the delete button or add button while you are currently editing something, it will
submit whatever you were editing and then delete what you inteded to delete or add a new entry.
I also made it so it shows an error message if you try to submit an empty form. Other than that,
I did not really do anything else today because it took me a lot longer than expected due to running
into some bugs. The real time interactions of the applications was what gave me the most problems
because some features did not act as expected when a different user did some changes. Tomorrow, I plan
to go back on working on MarkdownV and change it's state management system from the local useState hooks
and prop drilling to redux. Since I have actually never used redux before I need to spend a lot of time
learning it and since redux toolkit now exists, the official way of using redux, I plan to learn that.
