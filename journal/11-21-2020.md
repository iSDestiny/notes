Today, instead of working ony MarkdownV I had to work on Maverick because the users found
some bugs. After extensive testing I found that the found they found let to even more bugs so
I had to change a lot of the functionality of the admin form of the application. I made it so
the add button is now available at all times except if there is an error. I also made it so if
you press the delete button or add button while you are currently editing something, it will
submit whatever you were editing and then delete what you inteded to delete or add a new entry.
I also made it so it shows an error message if you try to submit an empty form.
