Finished 3 modules today. I learned a lot about RESTful APIs and configured my application to be
a more correct implementation as of a RESTful API. I got rid of the user sessions and utilized JSON
web tokens for authentication and authorization so I had to tweak a lot of my logic on both frontend
and backend. I also changed the way I handled errors since I needed to send the appropriate error
code when I caught an error back to the client. Other than that, I learned about async/await and
how much cleaner it is compared to the typical javascript promise chains, I will instead use these
going forward.
