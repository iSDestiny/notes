It has been five days since my last journal entry. The reason for this is because I was busy working on a new project that I was requested to build by a close friend of mine that is now a manager at an Amazon warehouse.
He had a problem at work that was hurting the productivity of the warehouse and wished to create an application
that could automate or make the process of a specific task way easier. The problem that he is faced with is
with keeping track of the warehouse delivery trucks that are outbound and trucks that are inbound. At the moment,
the current system of keeping track of this data is to use three different whiteboards. There are a couple of people tasked with writing the same exact data on three different whiteboards in the warehouse. This is a very
inefficient and repeitive system of keeping track of this data. My friend, realizing how bad the system in place
currently was, requested my aid to create an application to solve this problem. He wanted an app that allows
users to input outbound and inbound truck data on a form and for that data to show up on three different TVs
simultaneously. The app that I built to do this is called Maverick and I have finished and deployed an MVP of it [here](https://maverick-amz.netlify.app/).
