-= Evernote Clone for Programmers =-

Description:
App similar to evernote but instead of supporting only rich text it will support writing in markdown
too with full code syntax highlighting. I also wish to implement vim into the text editor because I
love writing my notes in vim which is why I don't really write my notes with rich text editors

Features (Priority Desc):
- Markdown text editor
- Code Syntax Highlighting for snippets
- Folders or Tagging
- Favorites
- Authentication
- Dark Theme/Light Theme (Depends on what the default is)
- Rich Text Support

Tech Stack:

- Backend:
    - Node.js
    - Express
    - Authentication with JWT Tokens
    - MongoDB with Mongoose ODM
    - REST API
